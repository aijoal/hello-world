# hello-world

This is the very start edition of the project on integrating and managing marketing data for Xinhai Corporation.

I'm Yanning Jia, and together with Yan Liang we are the main contributors of this project. Up till now we're still initialling the project. Based on Yan Liang's former work from Dec.2016, now we have gained a big progress on clarifying the data structures of all the possible field inputs, which consists of market segmentation data(geographic level and operation level-(mvp & non-mvp), marketing channel data(Online from SEM,SEO,SNS,B2B,EDM,Direct Click Through, including investment and traffic. Offline from Exibition and Sales', including investment and engagement), web analytics data(From third-party analytic tools and Business Links, including customer identities and browsing features), convertion data(R&R), and sales data(connected via the unique customer characteristic number)

Which possible types of conversion are there within each marketing channel, how can we discriminate them?
Which fields need manually input and how much time do they take up, are they originally part of stuff's daily work?
How to visualize the data, how many manifolds do we need? (What is the minimium items in the system? )
