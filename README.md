This is the first edition of Xinhai's ROI System of Marketing(XRSM).

I'm Yanning Jia, together with Yan Liang we are currently the main developers of this system, and our work is under the fully guidance of Xuxu and Dingqiang. XRSM is proposed at the end of 2016 as a continuing step of Xinhai's operation research, which at the same time an initialling strategic move to fight into the toB marketing service industry. The system is dedicated to quantify the life circle of Xinhai's marketing operation and make the most out of it. Given the expected 4 months period of developing, it aims to normalize and integrate data from Xinhai's marketing and sales departments, store and visualize the data in a user-friendly interface, and create ROI functions to support further decisions. If time allows, we'll work on giving automatic strategic suggestions based on operation models.

Yan Liang first joined this project and has done a ton of work already. Till now we have gained a big progress on clarifying the data structures of all the possible field inputs, which consists of market segmentation data(geographic level and operation level-(mvp & non-mvp), marketing channel data(Online from SEM,SEO,SNS,B2B,EDM,Direct Click Through, including investment and traffic. Offline from Exibition and Sales', including investment and engagement), web analytics data(From third-party analytic tools and Business Links, including customer identity features and browsing behavior), convertion data(R&R, including conversion channel, business need), and sales data(connected via the unique customer characteristic number)

Which possible types of conversion are there within each marketing channel, how can we discriminate them?
Which fields need manually input and how much time do they take up, are they originally part of stuff's daily work?
How to visualize the data, how many manifolds do we need? (What is the minimium items in the system? )
